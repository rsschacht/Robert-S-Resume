<h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <h3>What do I do when I'm not working?</h3>
        <p>I love computers, but I have a lot of other interests as well. <br><br> <b>Some of my interests include...</b></p>


    <h3>Hiking</h3>
        <p>I love to get out into nature and push myself to go on challenging hikes. Here is a picture of me in Colorado after hiking Pike's Peak:</p>

   <h3>Going on Cruises</h3>
        <p>I am a pisces, which means I love the ocean. Recently, I've developed a love for going on cruises. I like to go with my husband, Colin - and we've met a lot of great friends along the way!</p>
